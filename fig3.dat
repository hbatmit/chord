# The above is how fig 3's events work. There seems to be a problem in PZ 
# because after stage 2 (t=6 above), it is claimed that 5's successor is 44.
# But 5 would learn about 32 from 60 when it joins via find_successor, so 
# the OrderedAppendages invariant seems like it should hold.

# The next two lines are what it takes to get Fig 3 to be correctly stabilized
