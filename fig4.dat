# When 13 is "incorporated into the ring", it does so by stabilizing. During
# its stabilization, it inherits the successor list from it's successor, 17.
# That includes the node 20. When 17 fails, 13 therefore has 20 as its new
# successor, and not 25 as noted. The error in the counterexample arises 
# because PZ has neglected to reconcile the successor list during
# stabilization.
